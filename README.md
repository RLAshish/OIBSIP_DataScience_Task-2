## Steps Performed

1. **Data Collection**
   - Loaded a CSV dataset containing unemployment data in India.
   - Columns included: `Region`, `Date`, `Estimated Unemployment Rate`, `Estimated Employed`, and `Estimated Labour Participation Rate`.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked for null values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.
   - Converted date columns to appropriate datetime formats.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed trends over time at the national and state level.
   - Examined relationships between different employment-related metrics.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Created line plots to show trends over time.
   - Used bar graphs and heatmaps to compare unemployment rates across states.
   - Plotted correlation heatmaps to study variable relationships.
